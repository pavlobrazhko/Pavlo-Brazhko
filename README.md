## Hi there, I'm Yanina. 👋

A Data Analyst transitioning from 20+ years in Insurance & Risk Management<br>
based in Ghent, Belgium. Let's connect on  [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yanina-andriienko/)!<br>
🌱 I am a [Becode](https://becode.org/) alumni. Batch: BeCode AI & Data Science bootcamp | ARAI 6<br>
✨ Master in Accounting and Auditing<br>

## Projects I Have Worked On <br>
### ✨ Real estate price prediction<br>
Utilized scikit-learn's Random Forest Regressor for modeling, web scraping to gather data, SQL and pandas for data cleaning, and pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and Plotly for visual analysis. The application was deployed using Docker, FastAPI, and Streamlit. <br>
- [Part 1 Webscraping to create a dataset (in collaboration)](https://github.com/Yanina-Andriienko/immo-eliza-scraping-scrapegoat)<br>
- [Part 2 Analysis (in collaboration)](https://github.com/Yanina-Andriienko/immo-eliza-scrapeGOATS-analysis)<br>
- [Part 3 ML to predict real estate prices (solo)](https://github.com/Yanina-Andriienko/immo-eliza-ml)<br>
- [Part 4 Deployment ML model with Fast API and Streamlit (solo)](https://github.com/Yanina-Andriienko/immo-eliza-deployment)<br>

### ✨ [Churn Prediction](https://github.com/Yanina-Andriienko/Churn-prediction)<br>
Employed EDA to explore customer data, utilized a Random Forest classifier for churn prediction, and analyzed model performance.<br>

### ✨ [Wine Market Analysis](https://github.com/Yanina-Andriienko/wine-market-analysis)<br>
Conducted SQL-based analysis on a wine market database to provide insights for improving sales and marketing strategies. Created visualizations using Tableau to present findings. Applied Scrum methodology throughout the project.<br>

### ✨ [Accenture Usecase (in collaboration)](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ariana.bik/viz/Dragonyte_analysis/Story1)<br>
Cleaned and modeled the data, and visualized it using Tableau for market analysis and trend prediction.<br>

### ✨ Usecase: Telecom Tariff Change Prediction (in collaboration)<br>
Developed a machine learning model to predict telecom customers' likelihood of changing tariffs using Orange dataset. Leveraged XGBoost for modeling, with pandas and scikit-learn for data processing and analysis. Applied SHAP for interpretability of model predictions.<br>
